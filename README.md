2.Usability , Ranking , Districts Parameterization score, safety, quality of life, movility.

3. You will find the datasets on use instanced on map.html for now is on use the next data sets 
a [GeoShapes for districts] [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i/data] [GeoJSON] [Array of geometric points to create a shape] [58 districts] This data set provide the limits coordenates for plot districts NY areas.  

b [New York City Museums] [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/ekax-ky3z?method=export&format=KML] [KLM LAYER] [Coordenate markers] [100+ markers] this dataset provide coordenates of the NY city museums and 

c[NY Neighborhoods] [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/99bc-9p23?method=export&format=KML] [KML Layer] [Neighborhoods Names] [58 Neighborhoods] This datasets provide a marker in the center of the NY Neighborhoods

Brief Description
The generally concept is visualize a ranking of the districts with diferents parameters that can be considered for the user depending on your interest, and calculate a avarage score of these parameters, aditionally if the user want can download the ranking of each one parameter to see the better and worst score sort by zones specifically in these aspects. 

 Map View: Actually the map its locate on the center with the coordenates of NYU and can see the route from the district to the NYU. 
 
 Data Visualization: The idea is that the user can see on the map the main markers of the district like museums, art gallery, farm markets
 but aditionally user can see a circle graph with % score with 3 parameters of evaluetion for example if the theater district have more art offer than the other have 100% score on this parameter evaluation. 
 
 Interaction Form: 
 Any information output? Yes, How i describe previously the idea is plot graphs with parameter evaluation , but adittionally can download, the ranking for each district for each parameter in a table. 
 
 Any operation option (filters)Im working actually on pot the filter data previously on data structures to calculte the score of the parameters pitifully i did not have a lot of time to finish this.[Still not implemented completely]
 
 Any information input? Yes, you can put the name of the district on the sarch nave and you can see the route from the center to the district to the NYU.
 
 5.Test Case Which browsers did you test your project on
    Actually its working correctly for the diferent browsers, android and ios navigators. 
    
6.I working on filter and put on data structures the data of data sets for calculate correctly the scores.
